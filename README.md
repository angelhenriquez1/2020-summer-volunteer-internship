# Read this first
If you decide to help support non-profits by working on Opportunity Hack this summer, you need to be made aware of a few things.

0. Opportunity Hack is run by volunteers who have full-time jobs.  We'll be making time to help you this summer.
1. This is the first time we're doing this.
2. We're doing this to provide experience and education over the summer for students who may have had difficulty in finding internships, either because they couldn't find one or because it was [cancelled](https://github.com/gcreddy42/hiring2020).
3. There is no guarentee that you'll receive a job from the work you do with this internship.
4. All of the work you do will be publically available (i.e. Slack, GitHub, demos will be recorded and published on YouTube) for any employer and for you to put in your portfolio.  Ideally the effort you put in is equal to your chances for success in the future.

# Goals
1. Learn GitHub
2. Agile - sprints, demos, planning
3. Write code
4. Work with a team


# Projects
These projects come from our years of experince working with non-profits, we sought to generalize the problems we see in order to impact many non-profits, so although you'll see a few called out, we intend for these solutions to be used at scale, globally, at a relatively inexpensive price point.

## 1. Digitize Paper Forms
Non-profits are using paper forms.  The cost to digitize these forms to an HTML form in order to integrate it into their existing systems is difficult.  Google Forms is great, yes, but it still requires some effort and knowledge without allowing integration with existing software applications.

## 2. Simple Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR)
Some non-profits have "clients" that require demographics and treatment to be tracked easily.  This usually requires some scheduling component as well as a historical record of visits with services provided, then reports follow.
### Requirements
- Easy registration
- Record "treatments": medicine, music, painting
- Role-based access
- Secure
- Export data to CSV
### Examples

## 3. Risk Scoring
Non-profits need a way to vet the standing of people, specifically for pets, as they want to be sure they are going to a nice home.  Given a social media profile (and potentially their network) that someone has granted access to, analyze the content of their posts to create a risk score to understand if there are any red flags for pet adoption.

## 4. Data Analysis
Analyze trends to recommend areas of focus

## 5. Volunteer registration and tracking
Perform market research to recommend a system for all non-profts to use.
### Requirements
- Be able to list times available for volunteers along with location and duration of request
- Be able to specify skill that is needed (e.g. painting, drywall, electrical, math tutor, etc.)
- Increase communication between NPO and volunteers to increase engagement
- Be able to find volunteer opportunities in a region
- Be able to find opportunities that are good for families
- Recommend volunteer opportunities based on previous experience

## Examples
- SignupGenius 


## 6. Intelligent Donation Platform
Increase recurring donations or volume of donations
### Requirements
- Recommend other items to donate: if someone donates a TV, ask if they also have shoes to donate
- Cluster similar donors together to determine alternative marketing methods that may be more effective within the cohort


## 7. Inventory management system

## 8. Notification system
